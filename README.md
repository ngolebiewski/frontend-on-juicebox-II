## LOL, my notes will be like a blog about making a blog API!
- 10:17am Just setting up files seems a.o.k.
-   db is titled: juiceboxblog, very creative!
- 10:19 am installing prisma, etc. with npm init -y, following along on the prisma documentation: https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started/setup-prisma/start-from-scratch/relational-databases-node-postgresql
- 10:25am used the "install:stuff" script I wrote to install the various packages that will be needed. 
- 10:30am working on the Prisma Database Schema
- 10:35am looking up "One-to-Many" https://www.prisma.io/docs/orm/prisma-schema/data-model/relations/one-to-many-relations#overview
- 10:36am fingers crossed, about to do Prisma Migrate on this.
  -  ```npx prisma migrate dev --name init```
- 10:37am Woohoo! error free (as far as I know) Ticket #2 done.
- 10:39am Things running surpisingly smoothly so far. trying to get as much done before heading out for alternate side parking and typing in a car -- Ugh. 
- 10:40 Seed ticket #3. Psyched about using Faker -- I practiced that last night, to put in well, fake information. It's surprisingly hard to think of a bunch of fake information on your own!
- 10:42 Doing this... ```npm install @prisma/client``` ... thank you documentation!
- 10:45 looking up faker https://fakerjs.dev/guide/ for seed content
- 11:05 in car now cramped and on laptop leaning on steering wheel. First honks of the street cleaner are to be heard
- 11:27am finsihed seed.js. It's really cold in this car. Can't run heat because the battery will die since I hardly drive.
- 11:34 SERVER TIME - looking up https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html to remember how to require, etc. for server.js. I think I need fingerless gloves for typing outdoors in the winter.
- 11:52 API and AUTH routes set up. Just 38 minutes to go until I can leave this car!
- 12:03 PM made first auth/register api and it returns an empty object. MIDDLEWARE time!
- 12:44 back from car and whew, NYC is the worst in that regard! I couldn't figure out why my register api wasn't working and then 15minutes later, because i had "body" and not "data" in the spot to create a user!!!! Dude!
- 12:46 Making a french press of coffee ☕️...
- 1:05pm ...The coffee's really good. Plus, the login and auth routes are all set, including bcrypt and tokens. Lunch break.

- 1:32 PM Now, I'm so ready to continue with making some GET posts routes
- 1:40 BAM! Get all posts API call complete. Actually, what do you call it?  a route? an API? a path? a method? a restful API?
